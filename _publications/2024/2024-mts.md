   ML-augmented algorithms utilize predictions to achieve performance beyond their worst-case bounds. We design parsimonious algorithms for caching and MTS with action predictions. Our algorithm for caching is 1-consistent, robust, and its smoothness deteriorates with decreasing number of available predictions. We propose an algorithm for general MTS whose consistency and smoothness both scale linearly with the decreasing number of predictions. Without restriction on the number of available predictions, both algorithms match the earlier guarantees achieved by Antoniadis et al. [2023].
