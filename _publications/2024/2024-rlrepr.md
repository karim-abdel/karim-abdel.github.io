   This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper 'Explaining RL decisions with trajectories'. The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, and extend their results. We were able to reproduce the results only partially. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.
