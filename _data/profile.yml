    Hi, I'm Karim! I am incoming CS PhD student at UC Berkeley. My work is partially supported by the <a href="https://www.cooperativeai.com/post/announcing-the-2025-cooperative-ai-phd-scholars" target="_blank">Cooperative AI PhD Fellowship</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently a research intern at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" target="_blank">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a>, working with <a href="https://micahcarroll.github.io/" target="_blank">Micah Carroll</a>, <a href="https://www.michaeldennis.ai/" target="_blank">Michael Dennis</a> and <a href="https://anands29.github.io/" target="_blank">Anand Siththaranjan</a>. I am concurrently finishing my MSc in AI at the University of Amsterdam.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2024, I was a research intern at the <a href="https://www.kasl.ai/" target="_blank">Krueger AI Safety Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, working on goal misgeneralization and specification misgeneralization in RL supervised by <a href="https://www.michaeldennis.ai/" target="_blank">Michael Dennis</a>, <a href="https://uzman-anwar.github.io/" target="_blank">Usman Anwar</a> and <a href="https://davidscottkrueger.com/" target="_blank">David Krueger</a>.
  </p>
    Before my MSc, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/" target="_blank">Bocconi University</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://elias.ba30.eu/" target="_blank">Prof. Marek Elias</a>, working on learning theory and theory of algorithms. During my BSc, I spent the Spring '23 semester at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, supported with a full-ride scholarship.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in Reinforcement Learning, Cooperative AI, (Algorithmic) Game Theory, and AI Alignment. Currently, I am working on topics at the intersection of inverse reinforcement learning and assistance games.
  </p>
