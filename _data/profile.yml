    Hi, I'm Karim! I am a first year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/" target="_blank">Stuart Russell</a>. My work is partially supported by the <a href="https://www.cooperativeai.com/post/announcing-the-2025-cooperative-ai-phd-scholars" target="_blank">Cooperative AI PhD Fellowship</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in Reinforcement Learning, Cooperative AI, and AI Safety. My research style is a mix of both theory and practice, with the goal of designing methods which are both well-founded and that have the potential to scale empirically.  Recently, I have been mostly excited about designing better ways to do inverse RL and preference learning, designing protocols with the right incentives in human-AI collaboration, and in more foundational topics in RL theory and game theory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before starting my PhD, I spent time at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" target="_blank">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a> and at the <a href="https://www.kasl.ai/" target="_blank">Krueger AI Safety Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, where I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.michaeldennis.ai/" target="_blank">Michael Dennis</a>, <a href="https://micahcarroll.github.io/" target="_blank">Micah Carroll</a> and <a href="https://davidscottkrueger.com/" target="_blank">David Krueger</a>.
  </p>
    I completed my MSc in AI at the University of Amsterdam in 2025. Before my MSc , I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/" target="_blank">Bocconi University</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://elias.ba30.eu/" target="_blank">Prof. Marek Eliáš</a>, working on learning theory and theory of algorithms. During my BSc, I spent the Spring '23 semester at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, supported with a full-ride scholarship.
